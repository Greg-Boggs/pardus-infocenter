Pardus Infocenter is a tool for the MMOBG Pardus.

This tool is designed for sharing bulletin board missions, combat logs and hacks between alliance members. It consists from two parts: website and Greasemonkey user scripts. Website is written in PHP and is supposed to be installed by IT-responsible alliance member. Greasemonkey user scripts are written in JavaScript and can be easily installed by other alliance members in Firefox, Opera or other browser.

This tool, originally developed by Pio, was previously known as "Combat Logger", was written in ASP and then ported to PHP by Pio himself.

Now Uncledan/Larry Legend, Sobkou/Taurvi and Jetix/Aeiri are trying to bring on his great work and add new features to the Infocenter.
